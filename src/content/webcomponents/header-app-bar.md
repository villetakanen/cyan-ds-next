# App Bar

Styling for Material Design inspired app bar.

## Usage

### cn-tray-button

When using the tray, we expect the  [cn-tray-button](/webcomponents/cn-tray-button) to be
the first child of the app bar.

While the styling and funcitonality of the tray button and tray should function even if the tray button 
is located somewhere else in the DOM, positioning it as the first child of the app bar is recommended
for accessibility and user experience.
