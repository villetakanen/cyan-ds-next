Navigation rail works best with `hide-on-mobile`class, which hides the rail on mobile devices.

It's intented to act as a container for <a href="/webcomponents/cn-navigation-icon">`<cn-navigation-icon>`</a> components.

### Usage

```html
<nav class="rail hide-on-mobile">
  <a href="/route1">Route 1
    <cn-navigation-icon noun="home" href="/route1"></cn-navigation-icon>
  </a>
  ...
</nav>
```
